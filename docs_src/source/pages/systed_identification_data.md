# System Identification

System identification is a crucial step in optimizing your control system using PID Tuner. This process involves estimating a First-Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) model for your control system based on historical input and output data. This is particularly valuable when you lack a predefined model but have access to historical data.

## Understanding System Identification

### What is System Identification?

System identification is a mathematical technique that aims to characterize the dynamics of a dynamic system based on observed input-output data. In the context of PID Tuner, system identification seeks to determine the FOPDT model parameters that describe the behavior of your control system.

### Why is System Identification Important?

Understanding the system's dynamics is essential for effective control system design and tuning. Accurate system identification allows you to:

- Predict the response of the control system to changes in the input (setpoint).
- Design a PID controller that optimally regulates the system's output.
- Achieve desired control performance with minimal overshoot and settling time.

### The FOPDT Model

The FOPDT model is a simplified mathematical representation of a dynamic system. It consists of three main parameters:

1. **Process Gain (Kp)**: Represents the amplification of the input signal to the output signal. A higher Kp indicates a more responsive system.

2. **Time Constant (Tau)**: Denotes the time it takes for the system to reach approximately 63.2% of its final value after a step change in the input. A smaller Tau corresponds to a faster system response.

3. **Dead Time (Td)**: Represents the time delay between a change in the input and the corresponding change in the output. Dead time can be thought of as the time it takes for the system to "react" to changes in the input.

### The System Identification Process

System identification within PID Tuner involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: You provide historical data containing input (setpoint) and output (process variable) information. This data should cover a range of control scenarios and conditions.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: PID Tuner may perform data preprocessing to remove noise and outliers, ensuring the data is suitable for analysis.

3. **Parameter Estimation**: The application applies mathematical techniques to estimate the FOPDT model parameters from the provided data. This estimation involves finding the values of Kp, Tau, and Td that best match the system's behavior.

4. **Model Validation**: The estimated FOPDT model is validated to ensure it accurately represents the system's dynamics. This may involve comparing the model's predictions to the actual system responses.

5. **Estimated Model**: Once validated, the estimated FOPDT model parameters are available for use in PID controller tuning.


## Example: System Identification

Here's a quick example of how to perform system identification using PID Tuner:
